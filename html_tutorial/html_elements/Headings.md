Headings

Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.

There are 6 different levels of headings starting from <h1> to <h6>. The number within a heading tag represents that headingâ€™s level. The largest and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest heading at the lowest level.
