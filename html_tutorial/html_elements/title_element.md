Title Element
Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element:

<title>My First Webpage</title>

The title element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpageâ€™s browser tab.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
   
   <title>My First Webpage</title>
  
  </head>

</html>
