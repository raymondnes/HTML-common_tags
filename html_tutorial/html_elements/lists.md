Unordered Lists

If you want to have a list of items where the order doesnâ€™t matter, like a shopping list of items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.

Unordered lists are created using the <ul> element, and each item within the list is created using the list item element <li>.

Each list item in an unordered list begins with a bullet point:

<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


Ordered Lists

If you instead want to create a list of items where the order does matter, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.

Ordered lists are created using the <ol> element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element <li>. However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a number instead:

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ol>
