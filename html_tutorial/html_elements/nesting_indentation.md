Nesting and Indentation


You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson we indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known as nesting elements.

When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them. The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.

In the following example, the body element is the parent and the paragraph is the child:

<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam.</p>
  </body>
 </html>
